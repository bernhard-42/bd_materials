"""The user-facing finished material -- the material as applied to a build123d part.

A ``FinishedMaterial`` bundles a range-based ``Material`` (the shared, immutable
typical-values table -- physics) with the **per-part choices**: ``color`` (a
selectable base color), ``thickness_mm`` (pane thickness), ``opacity`` (how
see-through this particular part is) and ``roughness`` (its surface gloss/frost) --
these three only meaningful when the material is ``transparent`` -- ``finish`` (an
``AppliedFinish`` or list of them), and ``process``. ``.material`` gives the physics;
``.pbr`` resolves the three.js look.

Color precedence (resolved in ``pbr``): a covering finish color > the selected
``color`` > the material's intrinsic look (derived from ``family``).

Threejs stays out of ``import bd_materials`` -- only ``.pbr`` pulls it in.
